# Pewma.ai Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

- **Analysis Source**: The analysis is based on the `docs/architecture.md` document generated by the Architect.
- **Current Project State**: The project is a static landing page contained within a single `index.html` file. It has no JavaScript dependencies or build processes. Its design is responsive and utilizes modern CSS with variables for theming.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

- **Enhancement Type**: Infrastructure Deployment and Production Launch.
- **Enhancement Description**: The objective is to publish the existing landing page on the GitHub Pages infrastructure, configure the `pewma.ai` custom domain to point to the site, and enforce the use of HTTPS.
- **Impact Assessment**: The impact on the code is minimal (possibly the addition of a `CNAME` file by GitHub). The impact on infrastructure is significant, as it will be created and configured for the first time.

### Goals and Background Context

- **Goals**:
    1. Publish the Pewma.ai landing page to make it publicly accessible.
    2. Associate the site with the professional `pewma.ai` domain.
    3. Ensure the site is served securely over HTTPS.
- **Background Context**: The project has completed its initial design and development phase (the `index.html` file). The next logical step is its deployment to establish the initiative's online presence and enable contact through the `mailto:` link.

## Requirements

### Functional

1. **FR1**: The landing page must be publicly accessible and resolve correctly when a user navigates to `https://pewma.ai`.
2. **FR2**: The `www.pewma.ai` subdomain must correctly redirect to the root domain `pewma.ai`.
3. **FR3**: The website must be served exclusively over a secure HTTPS connection.

### Non-Functional

1. **NFR1**: The website infrastructure must be hosted on GitHub Pages.
2. **NFR2**: The DNS configuration for the apex domain must use `A` records pointing to GitHub's designated IP addresses.

### Compatibility Requirements

1. **CR1**: The deployed website must render without errors and visually match the local `index.html` file on the latest versions of major desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
2. **CR2**: The existing HTML structure, CSS styling, and content must be preserved exactly in the final deployment.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3
- **Frameworks**: None
- **Infrastructure**: Local file system (to be migrated to GitHub Pages)
- **External Dependencies**: Google Fonts (`Merriweather`)

### Integration Approach

- **Database Integration Strategy**: Not applicable.
- **API Integration Strategy**: Not applicable.
- **Frontend Integration Strategy**: The primary integration is at the DNS level. The `pewma.ai` domain will be linked to the GitHub Pages service using `A` records. A `CNAME` file will be automatically generated in the repository by GitHub to handle the custom domain binding.
- **Testing Integration Strategy**: Testing will consist of manual, end-to-end verification. The deployed site on the custom domain will be visually compared against the local `index.html` file to ensure a perfect match.

### Code Organization and Standards

- **File Structure Approach**: The project will consist of a single `index.html` file in the root directory. A `CNAME` file will be added to the root by GitHub during the domain setup process.
- **Coding Standards**: All existing code and styling in the `index.html` file are to be preserved without modification.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

- **Technical Risks**: The primary risk is a misconfiguration of DNS records, which would result in the domain not pointing to the website correctly. A secondary, minor risk is the potential unavailability of the Google Fonts service, which would cause the site to render with a system default font.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: DNS record values must be copied exactly from the GitHub Pages settings. After saving, propagation will be verified using an online tool (like dnschecker.org) before announcing the site as "live".

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic 1: Deploy Pewma.ai Landing Page to Production

- **Epic Goal**: To make the Pewma.ai landing page live and publicly accessible on the `pewma.ai` custom domain, served securely via GitHub Pages.

### Stories

- **Story 1.1: Initialize Repository and Activate GitHub Pages**
    - **As a** Project Owner, **I want** the `index.html` file pushed to the GitHub repository and the GitHub Pages service activated, **so that** the site is being served on a default `.github.io` URL.
- **Story 1.2: Configure Custom Domain and DNS Records**
    - **As a** Project Owner, **I want** the `pewma.ai` custom domain configured in the repository settings and the corresponding DNS `A` records created, **so that** web traffic to the custom domain is correctly routed to the GitHub Pages site.
- **Story 1.3: Enforce HTTPS and Verify Final Deployment**
    - **As a** Project Owner, **I want** the "Enforce HTTPS" option enabled and to confirm the site is working correctly, **so that** all user connections are secure and the deployment is officially complete.
