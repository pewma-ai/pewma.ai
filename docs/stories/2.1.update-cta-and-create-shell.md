# Story 2.1: Update Homepage CTA and Create Contact Page Shell

### **Status**: `Approved`

### **Story**

**As a** Project Owner, **I want** to update the homepage button to link to a new, styled contact page shell, **so that** the user journey for the new contact form is initiated.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. The button in `index.html` with the class `cta-button` is modified to link to the new `contacto.html` page.
2. The text of this button is changed to "CONVERSEMOS".
3. A new file, `contacto.html`, is created in the root of the repository.
4. The `contacto.html` page shares the same visual styling (fonts, colors, header) as `index.html`.
5. The new `contacto.html` page displays a clear heading, such as "Contacto".

### **Tasks / Subtasks**

- [ ]  **Task 1: Modify `index.html`**
    - [ ]  Locate the `<a>` tag with the class `cta-button`.
    - [ ]  Change its `href` attribute from `mailto:contacto@pewma.ai` to `contacto.html`.
    - [ ]  Change its inner text from "Contáctanos para saber más" to `CONVERSEMOS`.
- [ ]  **Task 2: Create `contacto.html`**
    - [ ]  Create a new file named `contacto.html` in the project root.
    - [ ]  Copy the entire content of `index.html` into `contacto.html` to serve as a template.
    - [ ]  In `contacto.html`, remove all `<section>` tags and the `<div class="cta">` from within the `<div class="container">`, leaving only the `<header>`.
    - [ ]  Below the `<header>`, add a new `<section>` with an `<h2>` containing the text "Contacto".

### **Dev Notes**

- **Context**: This is the foundational story for the contact form feature. It establishes the navigation between the homepage and the new contact page.
- **Goal**: The primary goal is structural and visual consistency. The new page should feel like a seamless part of the existing site.
- **No Functionality**: This story does not involve Formspree or any submission logic. It is purely HTML and CSS work.
