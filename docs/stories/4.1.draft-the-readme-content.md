# Story 4.1: Draft the README.md Content

### **Status**: `Approved`

### **Story**
**As a** Project Owner, **I want** to draft the complete text for the README, **so that** it clearly explains the project's context, the BMAD process used, and how it serves as an educational example for the community.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
1.  The text for the `README.md` is drafted in a separate document.
2.  The draft includes a section on the project's mission.
3.  The draft includes a section explaining that the site was built using the BMAD methodology with AI agents.
4.  The draft includes a section explaining how the repository can be used as an example, pointing to the `/docs` folder.
5.  The text connects the open-sourcing of the process to the overall mission of Pewma AI.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**
* [ ] **Task 1**: (User/PO Task) Propose a structure for the README.md.
* [ ] **Task 2**: (User/PO Task) Write the narrative content for each section.
* [ ] **Task 3**: (User/PO Task) Review the draft for clarity, tone, and accuracy.

### **Dev Notes**
* **Collaborative Story**: This story is a collaborative effort between the Product Owner and the user. The primary output is text content, not code.
