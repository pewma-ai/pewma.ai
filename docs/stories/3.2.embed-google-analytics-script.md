# Story 3.2: Embed Google Analytics Tracking Script on All Pages

### **Status**: `Done` 

### **Story**
**As a** Project Owner, **I want** to embed the Google Analytics tracking script into all pages of the website, **so that** user traffic and behavior can be measured.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
1.  The Google Analytics `gtag.js` script is present in the `<head>` section of `index.html`.
2.  The script is also present in the `<head>` of `contacto.html`.
3.  The script is also present in the `<head>` of `gracias.html`.
4.  The script in all three files is correctly configured with the unique Tracking ID obtained in Story 3.1.
5.  After deployment, real-time traffic is visible in the Google Analytics dashboard.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**
* [x] **Task 1**: Obtain the Google Analytics Tracking ID from the project owner (from Story 3.1).
* [x] **Task 2**: Obtain the full `gtag.js` script snippet from the Google Analytics dashboard.
* [x] **Task 3**: Paste the script snippet into `index.html` just before the closing `</head>` tag.
* [x] **Task 4**: Paste the same script snippet into `contacto.html` in the same location.
* [x] **Task 5**: Paste the same script snippet into `gracias.html` in the same location.
* [x] **Task 6**: Replace the placeholder Tracking ID in all three files with the correct one.

### **Dev Notes**
* **Blocker**: This story cannot be started until the project owner completes Story 3.1 and provides the Tracking ID.
* **Consistency**: The exact same script must be used on all pages to ensure user sessions are tracked correctly across the site.
