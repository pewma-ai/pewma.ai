# Story 2.4: Configure Formspree and Activate Submission & Redirect

### **Status**: `Approved`

### **Story**
**As a** Project Owner, **I want** to connect the contact form to the Formspree service and configure it, **so that** form submissions are delivered to my email and users are redirected to the 'Thank You' page.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
1.  A new Formspree endpoint is created and configured to send emails to `info@pewma.ai`.
2.  The `<form>` tag in `contacto.html` has its `action` attribute set to the correct Formspree endpoint URL.
3.  The `<form>` tag's `method` attribute is set to `POST`.
4.  Submitting the form successfully sends an email with the form data to `info@pewma.ai`.
5.  After a successful submission, the user is automatically redirected to the `gracias.html` page.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**
* [ ] **Task 1: (User Task) Create Formspree Endpoint**
    * [ ] Go to `formspree.io`, create a new form, and set the destination email to `info@pewma.ai`.
    * [ ] Copy the unique endpoint URL provided by Formspree.
* [ ] **Task 2: Update `contacto.html` Form**
    * [ ] Set the `action` attribute of the `<form>` tag to the user-provided Formspree endpoint URL.
    * [ ] Set the `method` attribute to `POST`.
* [ ] **Task 3: Configure Redirect**
    * [ ] Add a hidden input field inside the form to handle the redirect: `<input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://pewma.ai/gracias.html">`.
* [ ] **Task 4: Test Submission**
    * [ ] Perform a test submission from the live or local site.
    * [ ] Verify the email is received at `info@pewma.ai`.
    * [ ] Verify the browser is redirected to the `gracias.html` page.

### **Dev Notes**
* **CRITICAL**: The Formspree endpoint URL is a unique value that must be provided by the user/project owner after they create the form in the Formspree dashboard.
* **Redirect URL**: The redirect value must be the full, absolute URL, including `https://pewma.ai/`.
