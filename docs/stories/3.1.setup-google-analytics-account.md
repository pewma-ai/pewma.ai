# Story 3.1: Set up Google Analytics Account and Obtain Tracking ID (User Task)

### **Status**: `Approved`

### **Story**
**As a** Project Owner, **I need** to set up a Google Analytics account and property for `pewma.ai`, **so that** I have a unique Tracking ID to provide for implementation.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
1.  A Google Analytics account for Pewma.ai exists.
2.  A new property corresponding to the `pewma.ai` website is created within that account.
3.  The unique Google Analytics Tracking ID (e.g., `G-XXXXXXXXXX`) is copied and available.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**
* [ ] **Task 1**: Navigate to the Google Analytics website.
* [ ] **Task 2**: Create a new account or use an existing one.
* [ ] **Task 3**: Create a new "property" for `pewma.ai`.
* [ ] **Task 4**: Follow the setup steps to create a "web data stream".
* [ ] **Task 5**: Locate and copy the "Measurement ID" (Tracking ID).

### **Dev Notes**
* **USER TASK**: This story is to be completed by the project owner, not a developer agent. It involves actions outside the codebase.
* **Prerequisite**: This story is a blocker for Story 3.2. The Tracking ID is required before the developer agent can proceed with the implementation.
