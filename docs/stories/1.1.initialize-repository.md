# Story 1.1: Initialize Repository and Activate GitHub Pages

### **Status**: `Done`

### **Story**

**As a** Project Owner, **I want** the `index.html` file pushed to the GitHub repository and the GitHub Pages service activated, **so that** the site is being served on a default `.github.io` URL.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. The `pewma-ai/pewma.ai` repository on GitHub must contain the `index.html` file in the `main` branch.
2. The GitHub Pages service must be enabled for the repository.
3. The site must be successfully deployed and accessible at the URL `https://pewma-ai.github.io/pewma.ai/`.
4. The deployed site must render correctly and match the local `index.html` file.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**

- [x]  Task 1: Push the existing `index.html` file to the `main` branch of the `pewma-ai/pewma.ai` remote repository.
- [x]  Task 2: Navigate to the repository's "Settings" tab, then to the "Pages" section.
- [x]  Task 3: Configure the deployment source to be the `main` branch and the folder to `/root`.
- [x]  Task 4: Verify that the deployment has succeeded and the site is live at the specified `.github.io` URL.

### **Dev Notes**

- **Project Context**: This is the foundational step for deploying the Pewma.ai static landing page. The project is self-contained in a single `index.html` file with no build process.
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/pewma-ai/pewma.ai`
- **File to be Pushed**: `index.html`
- **Deployment Target**: GitHub Pages.
- **Expected Outcome**: A live, publicly accessible website on a standard GitHub Pages domain. This step must be completed successfully before the custom domain can be configured in the next story.

## **Dev Agent Record**

- Agent Model Used: Gemini
- Completion Notes: All tasks were executed successfully by the user. The site is confirmed to be live at the default GitHub Pages URL. Story is complete.
- File List: index.html (modified via git push).
